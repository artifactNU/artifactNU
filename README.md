## About Me

Hello! I'm a passionate student studying IT Infrastructure with a keen interest in cloud computing. I believe in the transformative power of these technologies to revolutionize the way we solve problems and improve efficiency.

Currently I am pursuing advanced vocational training in IT infrastructure at Nackademin, a prestigious vocational university in Sweden. I am actively seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and gain hands-on experience in cloud computing and machine learning. My goal is to contribute to cutting-edge projects that make a positive impact on society.

Apart from my academic pursuits, I love to explore new technologies, attend tech conferences and engage in open-source projects. I am a firm believer in collaboration and continuous learning, as they are essential for personal and professional growth.
